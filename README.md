# ðŸ“˜ Pandas Tutorial â€” Learning Journey

Overview
This repository contains my **learning notes and code examples** from practicing **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.  
The notebook walks through **foundational concepts** â€” starting from simple data structures like Series to working with complex DataFrames.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
The notebook covers:

### 1. **Installation & Import**
- Installing Pandas using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```
- Importing Pandas:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  ```

### 2. **Series â€” 1D Data**
- Creating a basic `Series` from a list.
- Using **custom index labels**.
- Accessing data by:
  - **Label-based indexing** (`series['C']`)
  - **Position-based indexing** (`series[2]`)
- Performing **vectorized operations** (e.g., adding a number to all elements).

### 3. **DataFrame â€” 2D Data**
- Creating a `DataFrame` from dictionaries.
- Working with **multiple columns** of different data types.
- Indexing and accessing rows/columns.
